A [Vaadin](https://vaadin.com/) add-on that displays a link that can be hovered for a thumbnail preview. It is based on a [jQuery](http://jquery.com/) plugin [LinkQTip](https://github.com/tjkaal/LinkQTip).

Main reason to create it was to demonstrate how a JavaScript component can be integrated to Vaadin 7. The add-on uses the state object and both client and server-side RPCs.
